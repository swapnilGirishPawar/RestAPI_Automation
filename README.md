# RestAPI_Automation

Thanks for visiting my Repo


**About me :- **

I am automation learner, working as a SDET.


**About this repo :- **

In this repo, I am creating a framework for restAPI Automation using 2 open API's
  1. create Airline 
  2. Create Passenger
Both the APIs are POST Apis, But I wrote a code for GET method too.

You can write your tests under src/test/java/$(yourFolderName)

in Payload.java file, you can create your payload using multiple ways
  1. using MAP
  2. using POJO
  3. using STRING
To start with your APIs just remove all methods written there.


**About POM.xml :- **

I have used maven repositories as follows:- 
  1. rest-assured
  2. testng
  3. jackson-databind
  4. gson
  5. extentreports
  6. datafaker
  7. lombok
  8. apacheCommonLang

**Challenges :-**

Curently I am facing challenges in extentReports integration part, so looking forward to merge PRs on that side by side I am working on it.
